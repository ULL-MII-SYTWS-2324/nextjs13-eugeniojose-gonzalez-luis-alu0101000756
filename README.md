## Lesson 11

In this lesson we learned how to create a form.

First we learned how to override components being server components by default.

Then we learned about react states and how to use them.

After that we learned how to tie those states with the values in our form.

We also learned how to use conditional behaviour when a button is loading.

Then we learned how to add custom behaviour to a button (or a form in this case) and how to make a post call to an API.

Finally we learned how to force the cache to reload
