## Lesson 6

In this lesson we created a mock json server and we learned how to fetch from there to our ticket page using a ticket-list component to do so.

We also learned how to make a component async and how to map the data we fetched to use it inside our component.

Also we learned how to do conditional rendering in next (horrible and distateful)

Finally we learned how to cache data from a fetch call and how to tell next when to revalidate it.
